- keep all files down to lengths readable by agents in a single pass
- stay DRY as much as possible, this should be our guiding code design principle, as it eliminates many errors and enables much simpler refactoring and feature addition
- use agents whenever it is efficient to save on context
- task-implementors should implement all changes, code-optimizers should run code review on their work after each implementation and before manual testing
- update appropriate docs on feature changes
